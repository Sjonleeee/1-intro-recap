# WEB3 - Recap exercise

## Goals

- Create an outline like this:

  ```text
    - Fake store
      - Products
        - Fjallraven...
        - Mens casual premium...
        - Mens casual jacket
        ...
  ```

- Provide the necessary elements with BEM classes
- Make use of CSS custom properties (variables) for spacers, font sizes, colors, etc.
- Did you hear about [aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) yet?
- There is a thing called [line-clamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-line-clamp)
- Use the Google font 'Roboto Slab'
- Use a gradient for the background of the page
- Fetch all the data from the API `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`. If the server went down, a local backup is provided in this project.
- Try to use [cloneNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode) to create copies of the existing product. Change the data with the products you get from the API.
- Show all the products in a grid. The minimum width of a column is 20rem, the maximum is equal to the available space. Create multiple columns according to the available width.
- Add some border shadow around a product card.
